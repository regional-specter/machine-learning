    "## **Timeseries Forecasting Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical models generate forecasts by decomposing a series into deterministic and stochastic components. AR models compute outputs as weighted sums of previous observations, while MA models use past residual errors to adjust predictions—effectively modelling how unpredictable fluctuations propagate. \n",
    "\n",
    "ARMA combines both mechanisms. ARIMA introduces differencing to remove trends before applying ARMA logic, and SARIMA extends this with seasonal differencing to capture repeating periodic patterns. VAR generalises these ideas to multiple variables, where each output at time t is a linear combination of its own past values and the past values of all other series, allowing the model to express interdependent dynamics."
